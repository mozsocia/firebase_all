To create a custom claim in Firebase, you'll need to use the Firebase Admin SDK, which provides server-side access to Firebase services. Here's a simple example of how you can create a custom claim using the Firebase Admin SDK in Node.js:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm install firebase-admin
   ```

2. Set up Firebase Admin SDK in your Node.js project:
   ```javascript
   const admin = require('firebase-admin');

   // Initialize the Admin SDK with your Firebase project credentials
   // Make sure to download the service account key file from your Firebase project settings
   const serviceAccount = require('/path/to/serviceAccountKey.json');

   admin.initializeApp({
     credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount)
   });
   ```

3. Create a custom claim for a user:
   ```javascript
   const uid = 'USER_UID'; // UID of the user for whom you want to set the custom claim
   const claim = {
     role: 'admin' // Example custom claim data, you can customize it as per your requirements
   };

   admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(uid, claim)
     .then(() => {
       console.log('Custom claim added successfully!');
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error('Error setting custom claim:', error);
     });
   ```

In the example above, replace `'USER_UID'` with the UID of the user for whom you want to set the custom claim. The `claim` object can contain any data you need, such as a user role, permissions, or any other relevant information.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions and security rules configured in your Firebase project to control access based on custom claims.

Remember to secure your server-side code that sets custom claims, as it grants elevated privileges to the user. It's crucial to validate and verify any input data before setting custom claims to prevent unauthorized access.

This is a basic example to get you started with custom claims in Firebase. You can build upon this example to suit your specific needs and integrate it into your application workflow.

## net ninja firebase functions to set claim

<https://github.com/iamshaunjp/firebase-auth/blob/lesson-23/functions/index.js>

```js
const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
admin.initializeApp();

exports.addAdminRole = functions.https.onCall((data, context) => {
  // check request is made by an admin
  if ( context.auth.token.admin !== true ) {
    return { error: 'Only admins can add other admins' }
  }
  // get user and add admin custom claim
  return admin.auth().getUserByEmail(data.email).then(user => {
    return admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(user.uid, {
      admin: true
    })
  }).then(() => {
    return {
      message: `Success! ${data.email} has been made an admin.`
    }
  }).catch(err => {
    return err;
  });
});
```
